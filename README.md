- 👋 Hi, I’m @tudstlennkozh
- 👀 I’m interested in computer science, python and LibreOffice (for the major part)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning all this stuff (LO and python mainly)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on [oosheet](https://github.com/tudstlennkozh/oosheet) especially, since it helps to save lot of time in Calc
